# Module E - Frontend Dashboard, Documentation, and CI

Module E owns the visible project dashboard and the delivery documentation
that ties the contract and backend modules together for the final demo.

## Current scope

The frontend is intentionally mock-first. It can run before Person B's
router and Person D's WebSocket service are fully merged, while still
matching the current contract shape from Modules A and C.

Implemented in this module:

- `frontend/` Next.js + TypeScript app scaffold.
- Deployment status panel driven by `addresses.sepolia.json`.
- Mock arbitrage opportunity table using the shared `Route` shape.
- Gas-vs-profit and price-spread dashboard panels.
- Commit-reveal and direct-execution UI states for Person C's executor.
- Recent transaction and liquidation watch panels for the demo surface.

## Integration assumptions

### Contract addresses

The frontend reads the shared root-level `addresses.sepolia.json` file.
At the time this module was started:

| Artifact | Status |
|---|---|
| Aave V3 flash-loan adapter | Deployed |
| Balancer V2 flash-loan adapter | Deployed |
| CommitRevealExecutor | Deployed |
| Direct ArbitrageExecutor | Deployed |
| Router | Pending |
| DEX venues and mock tokens | Pending |

The UI treats zero addresses as `Pending` and disables execution actions
when the router is not available.

### Executor flow

The UI supports two paths:

1. MEV-protected path through `CommitRevealExecutor`:
   - `commit(bytes32 commitHash)`
   - wait at least one block
   - `reveal(provider, asset, amount, route, minProfit, salt)`
2. Direct demo path through `ArbitrageExecutor`:
   - `requestArb(provider, asset, amount, route, minProfit)`

The current buttons are mocked until the router and live route data are
available.

### WebSocket data

The dashboard data model mirrors Person D's draft `WsEvent` shape from the
`off-chain-backend` branch:

- `price`
- `opportunity`
- `tx`
- `liquidation`

Once D's branch is rebased and merged, the mock data layer can be replaced
with a WebSocket client without rewriting the dashboard components.

## Run locally

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the local Next.js URL printed by the dev server.

## Maintainability notes

- `Dashboard.tsx` only owns page-level state and layout composition.
- Each dashboard panel lives in `frontend/components/dashboard/`, so
  future changes remain localized.
- Shared UI/data types live in `frontend/lib/types.ts`.
- Address parsing and deployment-status helpers live in
  `frontend/lib/addresses.ts`.
- Mock feeds live in `frontend/lib/mockData.ts`; replacing them with
  Person D's WebSocket stream should not require rewriting the panel
  components.
- The execution panel is isolated in `ExecutionPanel.tsx` so wallet
  connection and contract writes can be added there later without
  touching price charts or deployment status.

## Suggested commit / push checkpoints

Use small, reviewable commits that each leave the frontend in a coherent
state:

1. `chore(frontend): scaffold module E Next dashboard`
2. `feat(frontend): add deployment status and mock opportunity panels`
3. `refactor(frontend): split dashboard into maintainable panels`
4. `docs(frontend): document module E scope and integration plan`
5. `ci(frontend): add frontend typecheck and build workflow`

Do not use empty commits just to inflate the history. The course rubric
asks for meaningful contribution over time, so each commit should map to
a real user-visible or maintainability improvement.

## Next steps

- Replace mock opportunity data with Person D's WebSocket stream.
- Add wallet connection with wagmi once live execution is ready.
- Generate commit hashes from the selected route and user wallet address.
- Add frontend CI for typecheck/build after dependencies are installed.
- Capture final demo screenshots and add them to the presentation deck.

## AI tool usage

AI assistance (OpenAI Codex) was used for frontend scaffolding, mock-data
design, and documentation drafting. The contributor should review and
understand all code before submission, especially before wiring real wallet
transactions.
